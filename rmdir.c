/*To Niki implement rmdir
A small assignment for you~ It's quite similar to mkdir, just to reverse it. And also the relation between mkdir <--> rmdir are similar to touch <-> rm.
Just remember, you can delete the directory only when it's empty, or it is an error. So just check whether it is empty and delete it if it is empty, no need to make it recursively delete sub directory and files when not empty.
There are many functions in func.c and you can directly use them in your program. If you are not clear with the meanning of these functions, let me know. If you have any other questions, let me know and I am very glad to help.
There are noly 5 left and for size I am not clear with the meanning of it so I will ask Ben today. I will keep on working on the rest 4 functions: fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, good luck to me:)
PS: I want to your place last night, but you were not home. Everything going well?*/
